MEDIAN ABSOLUTGE DEVIATION:

Filtering technique (of outliers) based on the median absolute deviation (MAD) which allow detecting the variability of an univariate sample of quantitative data.

The median absolute deviation (MAD) is defined as the median of deviations from the median

MAD=mediani(|Xiâˆ’medianj(Xj)|)
and you can find out more about it here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation
