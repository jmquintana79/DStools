    "For four years in a row, data scientist has been named the number one job in the U.S. by Glassdoor. What’s more, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the demand for data science skills will drive a 27.9 percent rise in employment in the field through 2026. Not only is there a huge demand, but there is also a noticeable shortage of qualified data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daniel Gutierrez, managing editor of insideBIGDATA, told Forbes, “The word on the street is there’s definitely a shortage of people who can do data science.” If you have a passion for computers, math, and discovering answers through data analysis, then earning an advanced degree in data science or data analytics might be your next step.\n",
    "What is Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Martin Schedlbauer, PhD and data science professor at Northeastern University, says that data science is used by “computing professionals who have the skills for collecting, shaping, storing, managing, and analyzing data [as an] important resource for organizations to allow for data-driven decision making.” Almost every interaction with technology includes data—your Amazon purchases, Facebook feed, Netflix recommendations, and even the facial recognition required to sign in to your phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon is a prime example of just how helpful data collection can be for the average shopper. Amazon’s data sets remember what you’ve purchased, what you’ve paid, and what you’ve searched. This allows Amazon to customize its subsequent homepage views to fit your needs. For example, if you search camping gear, baby items, and groceries, Amazon will not spam you with ads or product recommendations for geriatric vitamins. Instead, you are going to see items that may actually benefit you, such as a compact camping high chair for infants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn More: Data Analytics vs. Data Science: A Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, data science can be useful for reminding you of habitual purchases. If you order diapers every month, for example, you might see a strategically placed coupon or deal around the same time each month. This use of data is meant to act as a trigger, prompting you to think, “I just remembered I need to buy diapers, and I should buy them now because they are on sale.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science benefits both companies and consumers alike. McKinsey Global Institute found that big data can increase a retailer’s profit margin by 60 percent, and “services enabled by personal-location data can allow consumers to capture $600 billion in economic surplus,” meaning they are able to purchase a good or service for less than they were expecting. For example, if you budgeted $7,500 to purchase a jacuzzi and then found the exact model you wanted for $6,000, your economic surplus would be $1,500. Data science can simultaneously increase retailer profitability and save consumers money, which is a win-win for a healthy economy.\n",
    "Data Science Is Helping the Future\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science enables retailers to influence our purchasing habits, but the importance of gathering data extends much further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science can improve public health through wearable trackers that motivate individuals to adopt healthier habits and can alert people to potentially critical health issues. Data can also improve diagnostic accuracy, accelerate finding cures for specific diseases, or even stop the spread of a virus. When the Ebola virus outbreak hit West Africa in 2014, scientists were able to track the spread of the disease and predict the areas most vulnerable to the illness. This data helped health officials get in front of the outbreak and prevent it from becoming a worldwide epidemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science has critical applications across most industries. For example, data is used by farmers for efficient food growth and delivery, by food suppliers to cut down on food waste, and by nonprofit organizations to boost fundraising efforts and predict funding needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2015 speech, Economist and Freakonomics author Steven Levitt said that CEOs know they are missing out on the importance of Big Data, but they do not have the right teams in place to perform the skills. He says, “I really do believe still that the combination of collaborations with firms’ big data and randomization […] is absolutely going to be at the center of what economics is and what other social sciences are going forward.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Pursuing a career in data science is a smart move, not just because it is trendy and pays well, but because data very well may be the pivot point on which the entire economy turns.\n",
    "In-Demand Data Science Careers\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science experts are needed in virtually every job sector—not just in technology. In fact, the five biggest tech companies—Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook—only employ one half of one percent of U.S. employees. However—in order to break into these high-paying, in-demand roles—an advanced education is generally required.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Data scientists are highly educated–88 percent have at least a master’s degree and 46 percent have PhDs–and while there are notable exceptions, a very strong educational background is usually required to develop the depth of knowledge necessary to be a data scientist,” reports KDnuggets, a leading site on Big Data.\n",

    "Data Scientists Are in Constant Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedlbauer concludes that while some data science work will likely be automated within the next 10 years, “there is a clear need for professionals who understand a business need, can devise a data-oriented solution, and then implement that solution.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science experts are needed in almost every field, from government security to dating apps. Millions of businesses and government departments rely on big data to succeed and better serve their customers. Data science careers are in high demand and this trend will not be slowing down any time soon, if ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to break into the field of data science, there are a number of ways you can prepare yourself to take on these challenging yet exciting roles. Perhaps most importantly, you will need to impress future employers by demonstrating your expertise and previous work experience. One such way you can build those skills and experience is to pursue an advanced degree program in your area of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Northeastern University, for example, offers master’s degree programs in both data science and data analytics which are designed to develop the skills that employers are seeking. Both programs also provide students with the opportunity to participate in co-ops and experiential learning experiences, allowing them to build hands-on experience prior to graduating. Once you have considered factors like your personal background, interests, and career aspirations, you will be able to determine which degree program is right for you and take the next step towards achieving your goals.\n",
