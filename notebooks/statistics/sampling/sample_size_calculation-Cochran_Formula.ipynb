    "> Big data problems [are] actually small data problems, once you have the right subset/sample/summary. Inventing numbers on the spot, I’d say 90% of big data problems fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don’t have huge data sets, you usually run into issues where even a fast computer will process too slowly in memory (especially if you’re using R or Python). It will go even slower if you’re processing data remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cases where pulling down data takes longer than running regressions on it, you’ll need to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how big a sample is big enough? As I’ve been working through a couple of rounds of sampling lately, I’ve found that there’s no standard rule of thumb, either in the data science community or in specific industries like healthcare and finance. The answer is, as always, “It depends.”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample size is a part of the population chosen for a survey or experiment. For example, you might take a survey of dog owner’s brand preferences. You won’t want to survey all the millions of dog owners in the country (either because it’s too expensive or time consuming), so you take a sample size. That may be several thousand owners. The sample size is a representation of all dog owner’s brand preferences. If you choose your sample wisely, it will be a good representation. "

    "## Cochran’s Sample Size Formula\n",

    "The Cochran formula allows you to calculate an ideal sample size given a desired level of precision, desired confidence level, and the estimated proportion of the attribute present in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cochran’s formula is considered especially **appropriate in situations with large populations**. A sample of any given size provides more information about a smaller population than a larger one, so there’s a **‘correction’** through which the number given by Cochran’s formula can be reduced if the whole population is relatively small.\n",
